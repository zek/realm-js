Merge in most of realm-js-private

An overview of these changes:

The JS bindings and tests for the adapter and global notifier are now here, along with a few assorted functions which didn't realy have any reason to be in realm-js-private to begin with. The adapter and global notifier themselves are now in object store.

All of the stuff around building with sync enabled on only macOS or non-linux (depending on where the check happened to be made) is gone as that was a relic of Developer Edition.

The real build system for node is now here. Previous there were two seperate gyp build systems (one here and one in realm-js-private) and we ran the tests against the one here but built releases with the other one. Unsurprisingly this resulted in the tests failing to catch build-system related issues and was a giant headache.

All of the release packaging stuff in the Jenkinsfile is now here.

A bunch of assorted test updates:
1. Upgraded from jasmine 2 to jasmine 3
2. ROS is now run via a custom launcher script like cocoa and java did already to let us customize ROS setup more. In particular, this lets us actually enable and test JWT auth.
3. Tests now put all their files in various temporary directories rather than dumping a bunch of stuff in the realm-js repo.
4. Integration tests for node and electron now test the actual node-pre-gyp binary that'll be uploaded to S3 rather than building it from source. Building from source for local testing is still supported, and the react-native integration tests always build from source (since we don't package prebuilt binaries for that).
5. Fixed some flakey and broken tests. Turns out a lot of the tests relied on specific timing to work without anything enforcing that ordering.
6. A bunch of Dockerfile updates: previously realm-js used an image based on Ubuntu, while realm-js-private used a CentOS base image, and neither supported everything our test/packaging scripts needed. They've now been combined into a single centos-based image. The Android image remains separate.
